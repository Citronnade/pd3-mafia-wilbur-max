Role bugs:
When someone acts before the drunk and the drunk tries to role block the actor, the drunk cannot role block (FIXED)
In starting up the game, the random selection makes a whole bunch of extra players (FIXED)
Mafia are acting when they are not supposed to.
If mafia is the lowest priority role in the game, they can't kill.
Duplicate names.
Any role that can kill, can kill themselves.
