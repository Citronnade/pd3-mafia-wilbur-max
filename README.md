Mafia
====================

Disclaimer: This is a tool for God in Mafia, not the actual game. 

Mafia is a model of the uninformed majority (Villagers) against the informed minority (Mafia)
Mafia sports a day-night cycle, where during the day, villagers and mafia talk and do not know each other's roles, and choose
someone to lynch for the day, if at all. Then, during the night, the mafia and selected other special roles act. 

All Roles:
Townspeople:
Villager - boring, run of the mill, villager
Cop - inspects people
Doctor - saves people
Bomb - if he is killed by someone, the killer dies with him
Drunk - blocks roles
Vigilante - kills every night
Granny - cannot be killed during the night
Fool - the town idiot

Mafia:
Mafia - boring, run of the mill, mafia
Godfather
Hooker - blocks roles

Third Party:
Serial Killer - kills every night


Night Roles:
Mafia - chooses someone to murder (as a team, all mafia members know each other)
Cop - chooses someone to inspect (may or may not be correct information)
Doctor - chooses someone to save from murder
Serial Killer - chooses someone to murder (unaffiliated with the mafia)
Vigilante - chooses someone to murder (doesn't know who the townspeople are)
Hooker - chooses someone's role to block (affiliated with the mafia)
Drunk - chooses someone's role to block (affiliated with the town)

Objectives:
The town wins by ousting all of the mafia.
The mafia wins by killing everyone who isn't part of the mafia.
The serial killer wins when everyone else dies.
The fool wins by dying.
